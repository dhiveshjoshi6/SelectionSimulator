I was watching this video by veritasium - https://youtu.be/3LopI4YeC4I?si=IAt5RrrRVYWESY9I. it was essentially about the role of skill vs luck in success. 
so, he suggested he ran simulation for the same. I took the idea and first thought how to make simple calculator for the same with data analytics. 
and, replit came handy. so in just 13 instruction it is ready.
